      So i bet your wondering why butterflies only live for about two weeks here
      is why :They basically just get wings to find mates easier and lay eggs.
      This gorgeous metalmark will probably only flit around for a few weeks.
    </p>
    <p id="Heat">
      I bet you didnt know that butterflies have 4 wings and not 2 as you may
      think. Butterflies need heat to move , when you see them resting they are
      warming their wings so they can fly. Butterflies can see colours that
      humans canâ€™t. So i guess you can say butterflies see better than us
      humans in a way.

    <p id="Camo">
      Maybe you are wondering how butterflies protect themselves or you
      wondering if they could , The answer is yes butterflies can protect
      themselves and they do that by adapted to have wings that provide
      camouflage in their surroundings. they have camo that maches larger
      animals like owls.
