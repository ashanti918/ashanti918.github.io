    <p id="intro">
      Did you know that the Natural blue Jays color isnt blue ? You heard me
      correctly! And trust me, this blew my mind too! Although Blue Jays, are,
      well…blue, it is just a trick of the light. Now i bet your wondering "well
      why do i see blue" you see blue because n a very basic nutshell, when
      visible light strikes the feathers, all of the colors pass through the
      feather EXCEPT blue. The blue color is reflected, so your eyes will see
      BLUE.
    </p>
    <p id="Test">
      How about you Try it for yourself. Take a Blue Jay feather, get it wet,
      and it will turn brown. You’re interfering with the mechanism that
      reflects light, so you will no longer see blue. Crazy huh? Another
      interesting fact about Blue jays are Male and female blue jays look the
      same! Here's how you tell the difference: Male's are usually larger than
      females,Second, their mating and courting behaviors give them away. Blue
      jays are often seen in courtship groups (typically three to ten birds). In
      these groups, a single female blue jay determines the behavior of the
      surrounding males. For example, if a female begins to fly, the males
      follow; when the female lands, the group of males also land.

      How Long do you think a Blue Jay can live? hmm The average age for a wild
      bird is typically 5-7 years. Did you guess right or close ? This number
      varies wildly based on the individual bird and environment, So not all
      Blue jays live a long time it just depends on enviroment and individual
      bird.
